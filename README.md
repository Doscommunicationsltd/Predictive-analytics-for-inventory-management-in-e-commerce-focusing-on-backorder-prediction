Predictive Analytics for Inventory Management in E-Commerce: A Big Data Approach

Project Overview
This project applies predictive analytics to inventory management in the e-commerce sector using a big data approach. The aim is to predict sales patterns and trends based on historical data, enabling businesses to manage their inventory more efficiently and reduce stock-outs or overstock situations. Various machine learning models are implemented and evaluated to determine the best-performing algorithm. The project is also accompanied by a simple GUI built using Tkinter to make predictions based on user input.

Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Missing value handling, duplicate removal, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual analysis of data distribution and relationships among key features.
Model Building and Evaluation: Comparison of multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Cross-Validation: Validation of models using 5-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness.
GUI Application: A Tkinter-based GUI to predict the total sales amount based on quantity and price inputs provided by the user.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Online Retail II dataset. It contains transactional data from an e-commerce company and includes features such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Quantity, Price, Customer ID, and Country.

File Name: online_retail_II.csv
Source: Available publicly via various online data repositories.
Make sure the dataset is placed in the root directory before running the project.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/inventory-management.git
cd inventory-management
Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have the dataset (online_retail_II.csv) in the project folder.

To run the Tkinter application, use the following command:


python app.ipynb
Usage
Running the Jupyter Notebook
To run the machine learning models and exploratory data analysis, open the Jupyter Notebook (inventory_prediction.ipynb), and execute the cells step by step. This notebook covers the entire pipeline from loading the dataset, cleaning the data, performing EDA, building multiple models, and evaluating their performance.

Using the Tkinter App
After running the app.py file, a GUI window will appear.
Enter the Quantity and Price values in the respective fields.
Click the "Predict" button to display the predicted total amount based on the entered values.
Optionally, you can reset the fields by clicking the "Reset" button.

Dependencies
The project is built using the following libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
scikit-learn: For machine learning model building and evaluation.
tkinter: For creating the GUI application.

You can install these dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Models Implemented
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Each model is evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) values. Cross-validation is also used for better model evaluation and selection.

Future Work
Implement more advanced machine learning techniques, such as Neural Networks.
Explore real-time prediction and inventory management systems.
Expand the GUI functionality for more detailed analysis and predictions.
Incorporate cloud-based storage and deployment (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.).
